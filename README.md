# Transverse_Ising_Quantum_Simulations
This repositiry is structured around a paper done on quantum simulations of the transverse Ising model in one dimension with my partner
Kevin Orellena. It implements and discusses a few simulations methods as well as providing a framework for understanding the model, 
quantum simulation, and the error involved in its implementation on the IBM-Q superconducting qubit architecture. Notebooks containg the 
code for simulations will be added overtime. Currently,only the adiabatic simulation done on qutip is availible. Notebook comments largely 
only explain the code itself, for discussions of proper parameter selection and of the simulation methods themselves, please consult the paper.
